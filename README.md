# AR-Menu
During a recent project, I developed an Augmented Reality (AR) menu card using Unity, a powerful game development platform. The goal of this project was to create an interactive dining experience by allowing users to view menu items in 3D through their smartphones or AR glasses, enhancing the traditional restaurant menu.
