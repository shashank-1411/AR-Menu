# AR-Menu
During a recent project, I developed an Augmented Reality (AR) menu card using Unity, a powerful game development platform. The goal of this project was to create an interactive dining experience by allowing users to view menu items in 3D through their smartphones or AR glasses, enhancing the traditional restaurant menu.  
Here's a template for a GitHub README file for your AR Menu Card project made with Unity:

# AR Menu Card Project

![AR Menu Card Banner](path_to_image) <!-- Optional: Add a visual banner or GIF of your AR menu in action -->

## Overview

The **AR Menu Card** is an interactive Augmented Reality application developed using Unity, designed to revolutionize the dining experience. By scanning a physical menu card with a smartphone or AR glasses, users can view detailed 3D models of menu items, complete with animations and descriptions, right in front of them. This project showcases the potential of AR technology in enhancing traditional services like restaurant menus.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: View detailed, lifelike 3D models of menu items with animations.
- **Augmented Reality**: Seamless integration of AR using Unity's AR Foundation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive navigation for users of all ages.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Compatible with both Android and iOS devices.
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for performance to ensure a smooth experience on a wide range of devices.

## Demo

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: The primary development platform used for building the AR experience.
- **C#**: Scripting language used for creating interactivity and logic within the application.
- **AR Foundation**: Unity's AR framework that supports both ARCore (Android) and ARKit (iOS).
- **Blender/3ds Max/Maya**: (if applicable) 3D modeling tools used to create and optimize the dish models.
- **Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator**: (if applicable) Used for UI/UX design elements.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AR-Menu-Card.git
   cd AR-Menu-Card
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Unity**
   - Make sure you have Unity Hub and Unity Editor installed.
   - Open the Unity Hub, click on "Add" and navigate to the cloned project folder.

3. **Set Up AR Foundation**
   - Ensure that AR Foundation is properly configured for your target platform (Android or iOS).
   - Go to `File > Build Settings` and select the appropriate platform.

4. **Build and Run**
   - Connect your mobile device to your computer.
   - Click on `Build and Run` in Unity to deploy the application to your device.

## Usage
